2020 was a year full of firsts. My first father's day, my first pandemic, my first deployment. 2021 has certainly already had it's share of firsts, but today isn't one of them. I married Kristin 5 years ago today, and I am so happy to celebrate another anniversary.

Out relationship has had many new hurdles over the last year, but more than ever, I love this woman. She's an incredible mother, and an incredible partner.

Kristin, I love you and I like you. For ever. And ever. And ever and ever and ever...

Don't take my words for it, here's what others have to say:

> "Greatest couple. Period." -Ciji Coblentz

> "Love the family you've become." -Denise Helmers
