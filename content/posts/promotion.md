+++


One of the most frustrating tasks I have completed in my military career is how to put together a promotion packet. This is the packet required for advancing to any NCO rank within the US Army. For me, I'm attempting to earn my stripes and become a Sergeant.

In an effort to leave the world a better place than I found it, I'm documenting my process because apparently I'm the first person to be confused by this process.

This is a living and breathing document that I will continue to update until I have succesfully submitted a promotion packet.

All of the information that we will be gathering and putting together can be found in [Army Regulation 600–8–19](https://armypubs.army.mil/productmaps/pubform/details.aspx?pub_id=1004369)

### Collect the following forms:
* [Promotion Packet Checklist](https://helmerscloud.com/index.php/s/dNtbB7MrtqBRwBx) AKA [Promotion Packet Composition, Elections and Preferences](https://helmerscloud.com/index.php/s/dNtbB7MrtqBRwBx)
 * There is apparently a July 2019 version of this document which is the "correct" version. I have it linked above, it is difficult to find online. The copy above is what I received from my S1.
 * Not all of by documents were loaded into iPerms when I completed m packet. Per the checklist, I completed a "Letter to the President of the Board. It followed [this](https://helmerscloud.com/index.php/s/L9fMnTTWFy9MYZt) basic outline.

* [DA Form 3355](https://armypubs.army.mil/pub/eforms/DR_a/pdf/A3355.pdf) AKA [Promotion Point Worksheet](https://armypubs.army.mil/pub/eforms/DR_a/pdf/A3355.pdf)
* Documents to back up everything entered onto the above forms

These two forms really guide everything that follows. Below, I've attempted to list all the paperwork you might need, where to find it, and what to do with it. I've also tried to indicate what to do if something is missing.

## Gather the Information and Supporting Documents

### APFT/ACFT Score:
1. Log into [My Training Tab](https://atiam.train.army.mil/mthp/)
2. Scroll down to the DTMS section
3. Collect APFT/ACFT information

### Weapons Qualification:
1. Log into [My Training Tab](https://atiam.train.army.mil/mthp/)
2. Scroll down to the DTMS section
3. Select the "Weapons Qualification" tab
4. Collect Weapon Qualification information
5. Log into [iPerms](https://iperms.hrc.army.mil) and collect last uploaded Weapons Qualification Scorecard
6. Your Training NCO should have this if you don't
7. If not there, download [DA Form 3595](https://armypubs.army.mil/ProductMaps/PubForm/Details.aspx?PUB_ID=1007469) and fill it out based on your DTMS numbers

##### Additional notes on Weapons Qualification and APFT/ACFT
Army sites are finicky. All the information is actually stored in DTMS, but most soldiers can't access it. For example, [AKO](https://www.us.army.mil/content/armyako/en.html) has a link that takes you to [DTMS](https://dtms.army.mil/) that shows you your weapons qualification score. But guess what? You probably don't have access. If you can't find this information on your own through the DTMS tab at [My Training Tab](https://atiam.train.army.mil/mthp/), go to your training NCO and ask them to provide your weapons qualification and the date. This is the way.
*  My S1 told me that "This (APFT) gets updated in DTMS with Training NCO. It will then automatically 
reflect on your ARB."
* My previous leadership lost my APFT card, which led me down a long and annoying path
* I ended up writing a new APFT card based off my DTMS values and having my SGT sign it. That is what I am including in my packet.
* My advice, **ALWAYS TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR APFT CARD.** Especially in the Reserves where your AGRs cannot be trusted to update your records appropriately

### Additional Forms to gather

* Technical Certs earn you 10 points per cert, Max 50 points

## Putting it all together
Now that you've accumulated all of the required documents and figured out how many points you have, it's time to bring it all together. I'm breaking this into two seperate sections, digital and physical

### Digital
This is what you should put most of your time into. You will be building the physical packet based off the contents of the PDFs I'm going to lay out below. The digital copy also serves as your personal repository for all of your documents. This is important because, despite this being the year 2020, the Army is woefully inadequate in it's record keeping. I don't know if it's poor training, apathy, bad databases, or a combination of the above, but you CAN NOT count on your command/leadership to upload and store the appropriate digital documents where or when they are supposed too. The fact that ALL of your leaders have a ["I love me book"](http://www.ezarmypoints.com/army-i-love-me-book/) is a testament to this truth.

So, here's what I suggest. As you compile all of your documents save them with the following format "NUMBER_DOC NAME_LAST NAME". The Number in the file name should be correlated with what order you want the documents to be printed out in.

More to come on this...
