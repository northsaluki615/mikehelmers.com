I did it! I, Michael Helmers, received my CompTIA Security+ certification! This is exciting for me. I began working in IT back in 2016. The whole Account Managing/Sales thing wasn’t making me happy. Endless meetings and work that I could not get excited about.

I decided to do something about it. When Kristin and I moved to Madison I decided to take a chance. I studied to earn my CompTIA certifications, The first being Comptia A+. These certs were going to be my way into IT without any other formal education. And it worked. I got a job with the DOT providing Tech Support. Along the way I also earned my Networking+.

The CompTIA Security+ is culmination of this journey, and opens up so many new doors.

I’m incredibly excited. Yay me!
