<p>Now that we&#8217;re in 2019, I&#8217;m going to attempt a year long project of becoming a better photographer. Inspired by a post by Dogwood Photography, <a href="https://dogwood.photography/52weekchallenge2019">article here</a>, I want to take at least 52 pictures over the course of 2019.</p>



<p>Here is a snippet of what to expect for the first 10 weeks:</p>



<table class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><tbody><tr><td>Week 1</td><td>Story Telling: Self-Portrait</td><td>Take a picture that tells us who you are, without actually showing your face.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 2</td><td>Composition: Rule of Thirds Motion</td><td>You already know what the rule of thirds is, now is the time to use it. Use Rule of Thirds to show motion in your picture.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 3</td><td>Inspiration: Black and White</td><td> Your inspiration this week is to simply take an amazing Black and White photograph of any subject you want.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 4</td><td>Story Telling: Warmth</td><td>Tell a story that makes us feel warm inside.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 5</td><td>Composition: Symmetry Landscape</td><td>Landscape
 is one of the most practiced type of photography. Use Symmetry in a 
Landscape to create a new viewpoint for this week&#8217;s image.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 6</td><td>Inspiration: #NoFilter</td><td>No
 limit on what you shoot this week, as long as the image is pure. No 
filters, presets or other edits. Basic exposure corrections only this 
week.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 7</td><td>Story Telling: Love Story</td><td>Make us feel the love in this week&#8217;s photo. Tell a love story in one image.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 8</td><td>Composition: Leading Lines</td><td>It
 is easy to use Leading Lines to show depth in an image or guide the eye
 to a specific spot in the image. Instead, this week use leading lines 
to show the concept of infinity.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 9</td><td>Inspiration: Mood</td><td>Your Artistic Inspiration this week is the mood you are feeling today. Take that mood and use it to create art.</td></tr><tr><td>Week 10</td><td>Story Telling: Hometown</td><td>Tell
 us the story of your hometown. It could be a famous landmark, something
 the town is known for, or even just your favorite place to relax.</td></tr></tbody></table>
