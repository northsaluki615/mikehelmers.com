Now that we’re in 2019, I’m going to attempt a year long project of becoming a better photographer. Inspired by a post by Dogwood Photography, [article here](https://dogwood.photography/52weekchallenge2019), I want to take at least 52 pictures over the course of 2019.

Here is a snippet of what to expect for the first 10 weeks:

Week 1

Story Telling: Self-Portrait

Take a picture that tells us who you are, without actually showing your face.

Week 2

Composition: Rule of Thirds Motion

You already know what the rule of thirds is, now is the time to use it. Use Rule of Thirds to show motion in your picture.

Week 3

Inspiration: Black and White

Your inspiration this week is to simply take an amazing Black and White photograph of any subject you want.

Week 4

Story Telling: Warmth

Tell a story that makes us feel warm inside.

Week 5

Composition: Symmetry Landscape

Landscape is one of the most practiced type of photography. Use Symmetry in a Landscape to create a new viewpoint for this week’s image.

Week 6

Inspiration: #NoFilter

No limit on what you shoot this week, as long as the image is pure. No filters, presets or other edits. Basic exposure corrections only this week.

Week 7

Story Telling: Love Story

Make us feel the love in this week’s photo. Tell a love story in one image.

Week 8

Composition: Leading Lines

It is easy to use Leading Lines to show depth in an image or guide the eye to a specific spot in the image. Instead, this week use leading lines to show the concept of infinity.

Week 9

Inspiration: Mood

Your Artistic Inspiration this week is the mood you are feeling today. Take that mood and use it to create art.

Week 10

Story Telling: Hometown

Tell us the story of your hometown. It could be a famous landmark, something the town is known for, or even just your favorite place to relax.
