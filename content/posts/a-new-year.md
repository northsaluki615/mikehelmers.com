2018 was a long year.

The year started me with leaving Madison, WI to join the Army Reserves. I didn’t come home until August. It’s been a long year.

Upon coming home, Kristin (my wife) and I started trying to conceive. We immediately got pregnant and were overjoyed. Then we lost the pregnancy. It’s been a long year.

Republicans were finally defeated in Wisconsin’s Gubernatorial race. Wisconsin Republicans immediately passed Lame Duck legislation to cripple the Governor’s office. It’s been a long year.

Assholes still don’t believe women when they say that they were sexually assaulted. It’s been a long year.

But now 2018 is over. 2019 is here.

I’ve had my blog Mike Learns Tech running for a couple years now. That project was put on hold for much of 2018 due to my chaotic life. This year I will be more on track.

I’ve also started a new blog here. This is just a place for me to write and share what’s going on with my life. I like the control my own website gives me, so I’m excited to move forward.

Now don’t worry. You can still read about my tech adventures at ~~tech.mikehelmers.com~~ [helmers.io](https://helmers.io)

Welcome to 2019, and a new home for Mike Helmers on the Internet.
