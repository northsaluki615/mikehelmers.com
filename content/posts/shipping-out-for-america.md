Some of you know, other don't, but here it is:Uncle Sam has knocked, and I'm answering the door. I will soon be mobilized and sent somewhere.

Now, I can hear the questions already. How long will you be gone? Will you visit ____? Why are you going to _____? Why do we have a base there?

I'll do my best to answer as many questions as possible.

### FAQ

1. How long will you be gone?It looks like many months. Some of that time will be spent training, but I will come home
2. Where are you going?Need to know only. AKA, ask Kristin
3. How does your wife feel about this?She's not thrilled, but we knew what we were getting into when I enlisted.
4. Wait, your SPC Helmers, not CPT Helmers?Correct, CPT Helmers is in Germany.
5. Is there anything I can do to help you and your family?Yes. Provide dinner to Kristin and James and send dog pictures. Also, if visiting Madison, provide Wendy many scritches.

### Contacting Mike

While on this deployment I will not have my typical Verizon cell number. I did get a new number with T-Mobile, which is listed below. My preferred method of communication is really any encrypted method. If texting, I prefer you to use the [Signal app](https://www.signal.org/).
