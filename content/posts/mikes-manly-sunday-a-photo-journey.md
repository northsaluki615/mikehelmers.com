Kristin feeding James his first brunch

I had a manly Sunday. It began as many Sundays do, with brunch. Now, I once read that Brunch without booze is just a sad late breakfast, and I couldn’t agree more. The family went off to Shortstack in Madison, WI with some friends, and enjoyed some comraderie, alcohol, and eggs.

This was a strong start. Next, my main mission for the day, to smoke a pork butt so we could have pulled pork. This would turn into a 6-hour long cooking process ending in an explosion of flavor. This actually began the night before, when I covered a pork butt with salt to let it dry brine over night. When it came out the next day, the meat looked amazing and I was ready to light a fire.

Lump Charcoal warming up

For Christmas Kristin got me a water smoker, and to use it, I light charcoal. I started using lump charcoal instead of briquettes, and it’s a much better experience. Aside from that, it’s always fun to light something on fire.

I quickly got up to the appropriate temperature and spent the next 6 hours adding fuel and wood to smoke.

I also did other many things:

I love scotch. Scotchy scotch scotch. Here it goes down, down into my belly.

Still watching the food cook

After the cook, I checked the temperature of the meat and it was perfect! Partnered with some food prepared by my wonderful wife, Kristin Helmers, we had a feast. Little James even joined in.

Thanks for joining me on my Manly Sunday. I brunched, cooked, fixed a garage door, played with James, watched food cook, played with Wendy, watched food cook, sewed buttons on my Army uniform, watched food cook, had a dance part with James, and watched food cook.

Please enjoy my parting gift as a way of saying thanks.
